# ResiliAi 1.0 - Product Concept "Whiteboard"

## The Elevator Pitch
**ResiliAi** is not just a checklist; it's an **active survival intelligence** that lives on your device. It uses Gemini's multimodal capabilities to *audit* your safety before a disaster, *train* your reflexes with simulations, and *guide* you with a calm, reasoning voice when the worst happens—even without the internet.

## The Product Lifecycle (Blue Sky / Grey Sky)

### Phase 1: Zero-Friction Onboarding
*   **Step A: Auto-Location:** GPS pulls local NOAA/OpenWeather data immediately.
*   **Step B: Tinder-Style Risk Quiz:** Fast swipes. "House or Apt?", "Pets?", "Backup Power?".
*   **Step C: The Baseline:** Instant "Resilience Score" (e.g., 42/100) to create psychological buy-in.

### Phase 2: "Blue Sky" Mode (Daily Prep)
*   **The Hook:** A daily **"One-Minute Mission"** generated by Gemini.
    *   *Example:* "High winds tomorrow. Secure your balcony chairs. (+5 Points)"
*   **The Feature:** **"Sentinel" Home Audit (Gemini Vision)**. Users run this to complete missions and boost their score.
*   **The Training:** **"Drill Sergeant" Simulations**. Gamified practice for potential risks.

### Phase 3: "Grey Sky" Mode (Warning / Watch)
*   **The Trigger:** Weather API threshold crossed (e.g., Flood Warning).
*   **The AI Action:** Gemini generates a **Personalized Action Plan** based on the specific threat + user profile.
    *   *Example:* "Gideon, flood warning. Pack dog food. Move server rack upstairs."

### Phase 4: "Event Mode" (Active Disaster)
*   **The UI:** Switches to **Low-Bandwidth "Safety Mode"** (High contrast, text-only, offline-ready).
*   **The Feature:** **"Guardian" Live Voice**. Hands-free guidance when panic sets in.
*   **The Checklist:** Simple tap-to-complete actions from Phase 3.
*   **The Signal:** One-tap "Share Safety" SMS with GPS.

### Phase 5: Recovery
*   **Assessment:** AI-guided damage check (using Vision). "Check for water near outlets."
*   **Level Up:** Score increases for surviving and following the plan.

## The Winning Demo Script (3 Minutes)
1.  **0:00 - 0:40:** **Onboarding & Blue Sky.** Fast quiz. Dashboard shows "Clear Skies". User runs "Sentinel" Vision scan on a bookshelf to complete a daily mission. Score goes up.
2.  **0:40 - 1:10:** **The Trigger (Grey Sky).** Simulate "Flood Warning" injection. UI shifts color. Gemini speaks: "Flood warning. Move your electronics."
3.  **1:10 - 2:00:** **Event Mode (Red).** Turn off Wifi (Offline Mode). Show "Guardian" Voice guiding user through a blackout scenario.
4.  **2:00 - 3:00:** **Recovery & Mesh.** AI helps assess "damage". User marks "Safe" and we see message propagate to neighbor (Mesh mock).

## Tech Stack Strategy
*   **Frontend:** React (Next.js) or Flutter/React Native (for mobile sensors). *Recommendation: Web App (PWA) for hackathon speed, but mobile view.*
*   **AI:** Gemini Pro 1.5/2.0 (Vision + Text), Gemini Flash (for speed/Simulations).
*   **Offline:** PouchDB/RxDB (Local-first database), Bridgefy SDK or simple WebRTC data channels for mesh simulation.
